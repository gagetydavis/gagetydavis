- ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Gage.
- ðŸ‘€ This is my first creation on GitHub as I continue to expand my skillset in technology.
- ðŸ’» Currently I'm learning cybersecurity, with a a big focus on penetration testing. I love nothing more than solving puzzles except maybe my cat, Sophia. She's great.
- ðŸ¤¤ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything related to cybersecurity and learn alongside others.
